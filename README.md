Swift Playground App, developed for WWDC 22

## What is?
My playground brings, in a fun, interactive, informative, and easy way, daily interaction that we can have with dogs, in addition, you’ll discover some benefits of this relationship between children and dogs.

## What i used

In the development, I used to perform all the actions of the SpriteKit SKAction's game, to move the elements on the screen, the image changes, and the sound effects. One of the parts I liked the most in programming involved the touchesMoved function of SKScene I had to make a function to check if 3 swipes have been performed on the dog. I also used SKAudio for the game's music, and SKEmitterNode to make the rain.
One of the most fun and difficult things to do was the drawings as I do computer science, and I had never drawn like this before. I used my model dog for the images and sound effects. In addition to the images, I was also able to develop the songs, something I had never done before.
