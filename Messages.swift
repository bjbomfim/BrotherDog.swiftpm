    static var Petisco = "Pets can improve self-esteem and the ability to communicate with people recognizing body language. They can teach kids how to relate to other people and deal with non-verbal aspects, learning to observe and interpret the language of gestures, postures and movements. It also helps the expression of feelings and reduces anxiety."
    static var Coco = "Ops! Dogs also can help to develop human attitudes towards the animal as a living being,  awakening ecological awareness."
    static var Dog = "Do you know that pets can provide a better emotional development, tendency to smile, affective bonding, unconditional affection, physical contact and sense of protection and security?   They also decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and increased release of endorphins, which can offer pleasure by the sensory stimulation. It reduces the length of stay in hospitals, promoting greater collaboration and humanization, in addition to relieving pain and discomfort."
    static var GuardaChuva = "We can provide responsibility, a sense of identity and independence, giving the opportunity to offer support to another living being, allowing the child to perceive herself as a useful and beneficial person."
